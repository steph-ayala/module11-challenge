# module11-challenge

In this repo you will find this README file and two folders "Deliverable1" and "Deliverable2"

Deliverable1 folder contains a jupiter file completing Part1.

Deliverable2 contains a csv and a jupter notebook completing Part 2 of the homework.

I have used the resources provided to find this data which include both Mars websites.

I have also used xpert with problems as well as a tutoring session.
